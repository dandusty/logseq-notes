- Tony365's workflow
  Hola amigo
  I use LS from different places without issues (but it needs some attention)
  * Home PC Desktop Application - My local folder is a clone git of my private repo + I have a local script that Pull / Push the changes to GitHub every 30 min (off course you can change the schedule depending on your needs
  * Office PC Web Application - I usually don't start writing anything before I make sure that the latest updates are pulled (I check the green light + make sure that the last pull date is recent or not appearing at all)
  * Lupin on the go to get thoughts on the go: nothing to pay attention here since Lupin talks/updates directly to my github repo
  * Mobile web interface if I ever need to retrieve info on the go, I usually don't add anything there but, if I do for whatever reason, I follow the same procedure as Office PC
  
  I rarely have conflicts but, in case happens, this can easily be solved using GIT
  
  it is a bit of a "Technical's person" setup but it works great for me
