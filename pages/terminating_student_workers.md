title: Terminating Student Workers
---

## Greetings OIT Managers,

This email is to provide a quick update regarding student terminations and active status.

When student employees are no longer working with OIT, please promptly submit an end of appointment transaction via OneUSG Connect.  Doing so, ensures the system accurately reflects the working and reporting relationship. 

How do I terminate a direct report?




The effective date should be the day after the last day worked.
The “reason” is End of Student Employment.
Be sure to include a brief statement in the comments section. Example: “Student graduated” or “Student accepted employment in another department”.

If your student employee(s) takes a semester off work, but remain active, please be mindful of the following:

GT systems cannot recognize when students take the semester off because they still have an active employee record.
They are responsible for completing all requirements of active employees (annual trainings, etc). 
As their manager, you are responsible for ensuring and enforcing completion. 
You will be responsible for including those employees in all requests pertaining to your direct reports.

Post your review, please respond directly to Valeria and myself with any questions.

Enjoy your weekend!

Kind regards,

Natacia Jackson, aPHR
