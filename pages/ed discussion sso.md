## Alex Fang will try to test

## Follow log search instructions in the [CAS 6 Runbook](http://iamweb1.iam.gatech.edu/docs/internal/runbooks/cas6) #sso
## Alex is able to reproduce the signature error by using his test account.  He will look at the signing libraries he's using to determine what the error is.
## Alex recommends turning on signResponse and encryptAssertions.  Also, sign encryption if possible.
## We will retest and see if we get a different error message
## Alex mentioned that he might be able to turn off encryption or signing if we can't get it to work
