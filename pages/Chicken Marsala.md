### INGREDIENTS

### Chicken:

-   1/2 cup all-purpose flour (plain flour)
-   1 teaspoon kosher salt
-   1 teaspoon garlic powder
-   1/2 teaspoon black cracked pepper
-   2 large boneless skinless chicken breasts, halved horizontally to make 4 fillets\*
-   2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
-   4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided

### Marsala Sauce:

-   1 tablespoon unsalted butter as needed
-   8 ounces (250g) brown or Cremini mushrooms, sliced
-   4\-5 cloves garlic, minced
-   3/4 cup dry Marsala wine
-   1 1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth (or stock)
-   3/4 cup heavy cream (thickened cream, evaporated milk or half and half may also be used)\*\*
-   2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley

### INSTRUCTIONS

-   Mix the flour, salt, garlic powder and pepper in a shallow bowl. Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture and shake off excess.
    
-   Heat 1 tablespoon oil and 2 tablespoons butter in a 12-inch pan or skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Fry 2 of the chicken breasts until golden-brown on both sides (about 3 to 4 minutes per side). Transfer to warm plate, tent with foil and keep warm. Repeat the same with the remaining 2 chicken breasts.
    
-   In the same pan with remaining pan grease leftover from the chicken, melt 1 tablespoon of butter. Add the mushrooms and for 2-3 minutes until browned, scraping away at any of the leftover chicken bits off the bottom of the pan.
    
-   Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
    
-   Pour in the Marsala and the broth and simmer until reduced by half and starting to thicken, (about 10-15 minutes).
    
-   Pour in the cream and return the chicken back into the sauce. Cook until the sauce thickens (about 3 minutes). Garnish with chopped parsley and serve immediately. (The sauce will continue to thicken off the heat.)
    
-   Serve over cooked angel hair pasta (or pasta of choice), rice, potatoes, cauliflower rice or zucchini noodles, if desired.
    

### NOTES

\*For pounding chicken breasts method:

You will need 4 chicken breasts (skinless and boneless). Place one chicken breast in between sheets of plastic wrap (or in a ziplock bag) and use a flat side of a meat mallet or rolling pin to pound and flatten to an even 1/4-inch thickness. Set the flattened chicken breast aside and repeat with remaining breasts.

Continue on from Step 2.

\*\*If using half and half, be careful not to bring your sauce to a rapid boil or it may curdle.

### Storage

Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.
