- Working with Bert to set up test in [[CAS Environments]]
	- Meeting on [[Bert's Bluejeans]]
- [[CAS 6 Working Sessions with Paul]]
- [[Pressure Cooker Chicken Rice]]
	- For dinner on 10.29.2019, After I started with 2 cups of water and three large chicken thighs, I ended up with a little over 3 cups of chicken broth.  I then used a little over 2 cups of rice and the 3 cups and change of broth from the chicken to make the Chicken Rice.  I pressure cooked on high for 8 minutes, natural released for 10 minutes, and then quick released the remainder of pressure.  Really liked the result.
